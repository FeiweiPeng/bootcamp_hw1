## Problem & Context
<plain language summary>
The project aims to design and evaluate an intraday momentum trading strategy for highly liquid U.S. equity ETFs, such as SPY and QQQ. The goal is to capture short-term price trends within the trading day by identifying periods of sustained directional movement. This strategy is intended to improve intraday returns while controlling for drawdowns and transaction costs. By systematically testing momentum signals and execution rules, the strategy will provide a robust framework for short-horizon trading decisions.
